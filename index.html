    <!-- First page: Header with what looks like a div and the position
    property. Center div with h1, horizontal line, picture with 3 paragraphs flowing
    around it. Central div does not reach bottom of page. Fixed footer at the bottom of page with teal top margin
    links to other pages "About" "Portfolio" and "Contact" are right justified, most
    likely 3 separate divs with a bolded or colored single margin. Grey
    backgound to body. White background to central div. Small "copyright" and icon in footer. Footer 
    is a gunmetal grey. It appears that all pages will have the same base with center divs of differing sizes.-->
